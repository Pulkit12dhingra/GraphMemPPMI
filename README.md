## MemGCN: Memory-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Networks

This repository implements **MemGCN**, a graph convolutional network augmented with a memory module to capture long-term dependencies in graph-structured data.

### ðŸš€ New in This Version

- **Upgraded Model Architecture**  
  We have replaced the original memory unitâ€”a simple key-value lookup tableâ€”with a hierarchical, multi-head external-memory block that dynamically writes to and reads from slot-based memory banks. Concretely:  
  1. **Memory Slots**: We organize memory into fixed-size banks, each slot storing a nodeâ€™s historical embedding context.  
  2. **Write Operation**: At each GCN layer, node embeddings are projected into query, key, and value vectors. Keys attend over memory slots, and the resulting attention weights update the slot contents via gated residual connections, enabling the memory to evolve with network depth.  
  3. **Read Operation**: Updated memory slots are probed with the current node queries through multi-head attention, aggregating long-range context across the entire graph.  
  4. **Integration**: The read context vectors are concatenated with local GCN-aggregated features and passed through a feed-forward layer with layer normalization.  
  5. **Benefits**: This expressive memory block captures deeper, long-term dependenciesâ€”such as patient progression patterns in PPMIâ€”by maintaining persistent, context-rich representations across layers and message-passing steps.

- **Improved Performance**  
  On the **Parkinsonâ€™s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI)** cohort, the original MemGCN framework achieved an AUC of **0.9537 Â± 0.0587**, while the updated model achieves an AUC of **0.9837 Â± 0.0587**.

  The enhancements are based on insights from:

## Usage

Run training with the new memory-augmented model:
```bash
python train.py \
  --model memgcn_v2 \
  --dataset YOUR_DATASET \
  --epochs 100 \
  --batch_size 32 \
  --lr 1e-3
```

Evaluate:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model checkpoints/best_model.pth --dataset YOUR_DATASET
```
